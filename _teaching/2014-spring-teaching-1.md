# Introduction to the Course
Programming II is a compulsory course required for the major of Remote Sensing Science and Technology. The objective of this course is to enable students to master the basic methods of C++ programming. Based on the C language taught in Programming I, this course develops students' object-oriented programming ideas and gives them a deep understanding and appreciation of the characteristics of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism in object-oriented programming. In software engineering, students are introduced to the basic concepts of code reuse, teamwork and version control. In terms of thinking, students will develop an engineering mindset and understand the process of problem identification to problem solving in engineering and understand the importance and significance of collaborative team programming. Through case studies, students will understand the importance of independent intellectual property rights in software. In terms of technology, students will master an object-oriented programming language and the way of thinking, rules and basic methods of object-oriented design, and understand the development trend of object-oriented programming technology. In terms of application, students will develop their sense of innovation and creativity, and will be equipped with the comprehensive quality and ability to design and develop small and medium-sized applications, which will lay the foundation for subsequent courses and professional practice.

程序设计II是遥感科学与技术专业所必需的基础课程，本课程的目标是使学生掌握C++程序设计的基本方法。本课程在程序设计I讲授的C语言的基础上，培养学生面向对象的编程思想，让学生深刻理解和领会面向对象程序设计封装、继承、多态的特点。在软件工程方面，让学生了解代码重用、团队协作与版本控制的基本概念。

思想方面，让学生形成工科思维模式，明白工科发现问题到解决问题的流程；了解团队协作编程开发的重要性及意义。通过案例让学生了解软件自主知识产权的重要性。
技术方面，掌握一种面向对象程序设计语言和面向对象设计的思维方式、规则与基本方法，了解面向对象程序设计技术的发展趋势。

应用方面，培养学生的创新意识和创造能力，结合遥感科学与技术专业的应用特点，使学生初步具备设计、开发中小型应用程序的综合素质和能力，为后续课程以及专业实践打下基础。
